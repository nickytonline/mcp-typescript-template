## Issue: Addressing Commit Message Handling

### Summary
There are concerns regarding the handling of commit messages, specifically related to Dependabot commits. This issue aims to address these concerns by suggesting potential solutions.

### Suggested Solutions
1. **Ignore Dependabot Commit Messages:**
   - Consider configuring the workflow to ignore commit messages from Dependabot to avoid cluttering the commit history with automated messages.

2. **Update Body Length of Commit Messages:**
   - Another approach could be to update the maximum length allowed for commit message bodies. This would need to be analyzed further to understand the implications and whether it aligns with the project's commit message standards.
